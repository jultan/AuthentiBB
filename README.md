# BlackBerry Authenticator

The AuthentiBB project includes implementations of one-time passcode
generators for BlackBerry OS 7. One-time passcodes are generated using
open standards developed by the
[Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/)
(which is unrelated to [OAuth](http://oauth.net/)).

These implementations support the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm
specified in [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based
One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified
in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
